Turkify - Interactive Turkish Learning App
Turkify is a Flutter-based mobile application developed to help foreigners, refugees, and anyone interested in learning Turkish. With features like video meetings, interactive quizzes, offline access, and more, Turkify ensures an immersive and effective learning experience. The app integrates cultural elements alongside language education, helping users not only learn Turkish but also understand the country's rich cultural context.

Progress Tracking: The "Progress Bar" system motivates learners by tracking their achievements and language milestones.
